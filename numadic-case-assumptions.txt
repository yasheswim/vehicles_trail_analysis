Assumptions made during data analysis:

-- Lat and long values assumed to be in degrees, hence have converted into radians before calculating distance

-- Aggregated distance values in kilometers

-- Report generated between time periods end_time = 1526543776 and start_time = 1525145685

-- If end time or start time are not mentioned, api assumes entries for one particular date range and generates report accordingly

-- If both end time and start times are not mentioned, api iterates through all trail data and gives aggregated report

-- Use uvicorn apis:app --reload to start fastapi server

-- use local url --> http://localhost:8000/api/generate_report?start_time=1525145685&end_time=1526543776 to call API from Postman

-- ignore both starttime and end time params in url if ypu want to keep both none

-- Ignore either params if you want to find for a particular date range only

-- If date range entered does not exist, message "Data not available for given daterange" appears

-- Please find report in datasets/asset_report directory
